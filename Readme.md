# Video Player with circular timeline
This is a HTML5 conversion of [my old Flash based video player](http://activeden.net/item/video-player-with-circular-scrubbingprogress/130624).

## The design
My aim is a miminal user iterface that works well within a wide variety of designs without colliding with the existing aesthetics. Still this should have more of an egde than just throwing in a standard Vimeo player.

## Cross-browser compability
This is first and fore-most a prototype or proof of concept if you will. It will be designed to work with webkit before any cross-browser adjustments are made

## No Flash fallback
I don't want to clutter the JavaScript files with fallback code. If you care about IE8 and below you need to implement your own fallback or send your visitors along to http://browsehappy.com/ 

– You'll be doing them a favor anyway :)
